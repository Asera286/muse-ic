Generating music from your brainwaves using the Muse headband!

This was a project for the 2014 SpartaHack hackathon. It was a project full of many first and didn't turn out how we liked, but I think we learned a lot along the way.

The idea was to create music from the output of the Muse consumer-grade EEG headband. Unfortunately brainwaves do not translate very well into music, and we didn't have enough time or experience to really tune it to something resembling a decent rhythym. In retrospect, we probably should have used some bucket ranges of brainwave outputs, and then use a randomizing function to select a piece at random from that bucket's selection of musical pieces. 

Please enjoy laughing at this humorous old project :)
